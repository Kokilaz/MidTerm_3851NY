What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A. JDK contains JRE, compiler and debugger.

            JRE - Java Runtime Environment
            Compiler - translates Java code into machine code
            Debugger -  provides inspection and debugging

What is IDE?

Explain the entire java life cycle.
A.java program will be written and then compiled by a Java Compiler. It will then turn it into a class, which goes through an interpreter. This translates the java code into binary machine code. It is then outputted to the computer.

what is class?
A. Class is a blueprint of an object.

What is object?
A. Object is an instance of a class.

What is the entry point of an application?
A. "main method" is the entry point of an application
Why main is static?
A. The main method is static because they can be invoked by the runtime engine without having to instantiate an instance of the parent class.
    Main is called by the JVM before any objects are made.Since it is static it can be directly invoked via the class

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A.  java.lang.Object class is superclass of all classes

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A.Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables. Classpath is an environment variable which is used by the Java compiler to find the path, of classes.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A. Interface: In interface we cannot declare a body. All methods in Interface are abstract. We can have multiple methods in abstract.
   Abstract class: In abstract class we have to implement the body. Abstract class can have non abstract methods. It can also have abstract method which is not implemented.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A. We can not instantiate an interface and abstract class. Instead you can instantiate one of their subclasses or implementers.

what is Access Specifier?
A. The access to classes, constructors, methods and fields using access modifiers. (public, private, protected, and default)

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. Object Oriented Programming System
       Encapsulation is data hiding
       Inheritance is a way to acquire all the properties and behavior from it's parent object
       Abstraction is implementation hiding
       Polymorphism is basically an ability to take on many forms. Two types of Polymorphism (Overloading and Overriding)

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. java.lang package is imported by default

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A. Application Program Interface. We have used BufferedReader, FileReader, Scanner, String.

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A. Java doesnâ€™t allow multiple inheritance to avoid the ambiguity caused by it.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A. In overloading we can have the same method name but different parameters.
   It happens in compile time.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A. It is an event which occurs during the execution of a program which disrupts the program's instructions. It is handled by try and catch block.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A. Static keyword that are used for share the same variable or method of a given class.
    Static variable:1)It's a variable that's associated with a class and not with the object of the class.
     		         2)Static variables are initialized only once.

    Static Method: 1)A static method belongs to the class rather than object of a class.
                    2) A static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.
                    3) Static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A. Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable. Final class can't be inherited,  final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed. it's a method.

What is final, finally and finalize?
    1. Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable. Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed. it's a method
    2. Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not. It's a block
    3. Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected. Finalize is a method.
What is a constructor ?
A. Constructor is used to initialize an object.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A. A class can have multiple constructors.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
What is compile time and run time?
A.  Compile time - the time period in which you are compiling the code
    Run time - the time period in which you are running your piece of software

What is heap?
A. Runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays are located.

How java manage it's memory?
A. Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease in size while the application runs.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?

       StringBuffer is mutable means one can change the value of the object .
       StringBuilder allows manipulating character sequences by appending, deleting and inserting characters and strings.

What is Singleton class?
A.
